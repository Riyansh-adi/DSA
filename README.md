📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice and implementations in different programming languages. The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming, and technical exams.

🚀 What’s Inside

This repository covers major DSA topics such as:

✅ Arrays

✅ Strings

✅ Linked Lists

✅ Stacks & Queues

✅ Trees & Binary Search Trees

✅ Heaps & Priority Queues

✅ Hashing

✅ Recursion & Backtracking

✅ Sorting Algorithms

✅ Searching Algorithms

✅ Dynamic Programming (DP)

✅ Greedy Algorithms

✅ Graph Algorithms

Each topic contains:
